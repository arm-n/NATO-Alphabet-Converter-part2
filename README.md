# NATO-Alphabet-Converter-part2
An improved version of the NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter with exception handling. This Python script reads a CSV file, maps letters to their phonetic codes, and ensures only valid alphabetic inputs are processed. It prevents crashes by handling invalid inputs gracefully, making the program more user-friendly.
